Hello! I'm an undergraduate research at the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/) and at the [Shabani Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/shabanilab/) at NYU. I currently search for dark matter using [astrometric weak lensing techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01991.pdf). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
